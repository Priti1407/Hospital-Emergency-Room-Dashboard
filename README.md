# 📊 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

## 📌 Business Problem
Emergency rooms (ERs) experience fluctuating patient volumes, leading to challenges in managing wait times, patient satisfaction, and resource allocation. The objective of this dashboard is to analyze patient data to optimize ER operations, reduce wait times, and improve overall patient care.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of ER patient records covering:
- **Patient Demographics:** Age, Gender, Race
- **Visit Details:** Admission status, Wait times, Referral department
- **Time-Based Trends:** Patient volume by hour and day
- **Satisfaction Metrics:** Patient ratings and wait time efficiency

## 📊 Key Metrics & Visualizations
1. **Patient Volume Trends**
   - Number of patients per month and overall trend analysis.
   - Peak hours and days identified for operational adjustments.

2. **Wait Time & Patient Satisfaction**
   - Average wait time per visit.
   - Percentage of patients seen within 30 minutes.
   - Patient satisfaction score analysis.

3. **Admission & Referral Analysis**
   - Admission vs. non-admission rates.
   - Most common department referrals and their impact on ER efficiency.

4. **Demographics & High-Risk Groups**
   - Age groups with the highest ER visits.
   - Gender and race distribution of ER patients.

## 📈 Insights & Recommendations
✅ **Peak Hours Management:** Increase staff availability during high-volume periods (7 AM - 11 AM & 6 PM - 8 PM).  
✅ **Reduce Wait Times:** Optimize triage processes to ensure faster patient handling.  
✅ **Enhance In-House Treatment:** Minimize referrals by improving ER capabilities.  
✅ **Targeted Healthcare Programs:** Address needs of high-risk age groups and demographics.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** (for interactive dashboards)
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** (for data preprocessing)
- **SQL** (for data extraction and queries)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Priti1407/Hospital-Emergency-Room-Dashboard.git
   ```
2. Open the Power BI workbook to interact with visualizations.
3. Use provided Python scripts for additional data analysis.

## 🏥 Conclusion
By analyzing ER data, this dashboard provides actionable insights to improve efficiency, enhance patient satisfaction, and optimize hospital resources. Future improvements include integrating real-time data and predictive analytics for better forecasting.
